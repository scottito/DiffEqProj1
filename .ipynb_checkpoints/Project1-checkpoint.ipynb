    "# 1 Introduction\n",
    "In the late 1980s, research scientists working for the National Forest Service in the Sierra Nevada conducted a study to understand why a\n",
    "native population of mule deer had dramatically decreased in size from a 1950s census. The investigators believed that the initial reason for\n",
    "the decrease in the deer population was over-population of the deer habitat. However, the population continued to decrease even after it had\n",
    "been reduced to a size that the environment could support. The researchers wanted to find out why the deer population never recovered.\n",
    "Over the course of the study, the investigators noticed that the native mountain lion population had steadily increased while the deer popula-\n",
    "tion decreased. Mountain lions are natural predators of deer. It is generally believed that a predator species such as a mountain lion benefits\n",
    "its prey population by keeping the prey population in balance with the environment. It does this by removing weak and old members of the\n",
    "prey population that would otherwise consume resources needed for younger, healthier members of the population to survive. In this way,\n",
    "the mountain lions (predators) are dependent upon the deer (prey) for their survival. The interactions of these species influence the evolution\n",
    "of each population over time.\n",
    "By studying the interactions of the deer and mountain lions, the researchers were able to deduce reasons why the deer population remained\n",
    "depressed years after its initial decline."

    "# 2 Modeling Individual Populations: the Logistic Equation\n",

    "Assume the mountain lions are protected from hunting and have no natural predators. The mountain lions depend on the deer for food, but\n",
    "the deer population is finite. Thus, the amount of food available to the mountain lions is limited. Since the two populations are being studied\n",
    "separately, the mountain lion model must account for this constraint on its size without directly including the interactions of the mountain\n",
